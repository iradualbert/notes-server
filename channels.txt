In this place you will feast like sultans. Asitane carries the forgotten tastes of the Ottoman to the present-day with its special summer and winter menus, by adding more than 200 historical recipes to its archives. To keep these authentic tastes alive, Asitane periodically organizes special weeks such as “Fatih Sultan Mehmet Period Foods”, “Aphrodisiac Dishes from Ottoman Palaces”, “Fish and Seafood in Ottoman Palaces”.",
